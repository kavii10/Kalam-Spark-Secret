## 🌟 Overall Summary

Navigating career choices can be overwhelming. Kalam Spark acts as a personal AI career architect. It starts by helping students discover their ideal career path through an intelligent personality quiz. Once a dream career is chosen, the platform uses a hybrid pipeline of **web crawling** (to fetch real-time industry data) and **Gemma 4** to generate a highly detailed, 4-stage learning roadmap.

Beyond just a roadmap, Kalam Spark is a full educational ecosystem:

- **Daily Planner & Spaced Repetition:** AI-generated daily tasks managed with a Pomodoro timer, backed by FSRS v5 and Ebisu algorithms for long-term knowledge retention.
- **AI Mentor Chat:** A persistent, multimodal AI mentor available 24/7 to answer questions, analyze uploaded images, and provide career advice.
- **Document Intelligence (File Speaker):** Upload study materials (PDF/DOCX) or paste URLs to chat with your documents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), create flashcards, or even generate AI-hosted podcasts using Edge-TTS.
- **Opportunity Radar:** Real-time curation of internships, hackathons, and jobs matched to the student's exact roadmap stage.
- **Career Pivot Analysis:** Evaluates the difficulty of switching careers and generates an actionable bridge plan.

## 🧠 Powered by Gemma 4

Kalam Spark heavily leverages the **Gemma 4** model family for its reasoning, summarization, and conversational capabilities. To ensure maximum reliability and accessibility, the application features a **3-tier Multi-LLM failover routing system**:

1. **Tier 1 (Primary Cloud):** OpenRouter API (Gemma 4 31B / 26B)
2. **Tier 2 (Secondary Cloud):** Google AI Studio API (Gemma 4 31B)
3. **Tier 3 (Local Fallback):** Local Ollama daemon (`gemma4:e4b`)

This architecture guarantees that the platform remains functional even if cloud APIs face rate limits or network issues, allowing users to run the entire AI pipeline entirely locally.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

You can run Kalam Spark in two modes: **Cloud API Mode** (faster, requires API keys) or **Local LLM Mode** (runs completely offline using your hardware).

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.11 or higher)
- **Supabase Account** (for database setup)

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor and run the SQL script found in `database/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables.
3. Get your Project URL and Anon Key from the Project Settings -> API.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `frontend/.env` and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# The app will run on http://localhost:5173 (or 3000 depending on Vite config)
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browser for web crawling
playwright install chromium

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### 🌐 Option A: Running with Cloud APIs (Recommended)

Edit `backend/.env` and add your API keys. You only need one, but providing both enables failover.

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-studio-key"
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

---

### 💻 Option B: Running with Local LLM (Offline Mode via Ollama)

Kalam Spark can run entirely offline using Ollama as a fallback when API keys are absent or requests fail.

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
2. Open a new terminal and start the Ollama daemon:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
3. Pull the quantized Gemma 4 model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma4:e4b
   ```
4. Ensure your `backend/.env` has the Ollama configuration (this is usually the default):
   ```env
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
   OLLAMA_MODEL="gemma4:e4b"
   ```
5. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
   _Note: If no cloud API keys are provided in `.env`, the backend will automatically route all AI requests to your local Ollama instance._
